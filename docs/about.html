<h3>Some history</h3>

Drumlabooh was written as the replacement of <a href="https://github.com/psemiletov/drumrox">Drumrox</a>, my fork of DrMr (see <a href="https://github.com/nicklan/drmr">Nicklan's DrMr</a>  and <a href="https://github.com/falkTX/drmr">Filipe Coelho's fork</a>.

<p>DrMr is cool C/Gtk+2 LV2 plugin that I used for a years, but then it stopped support current Hydrogen's drumkit format. First I "fixed" kits XML files manually, and at the some point I made a fork of DrMr called Drumrox and fix it at the XML parsing level.
</p>

<p>It was a spring 2023.</p>

<p>The C language is not my favourite, so I converted codebase to C++ and wrote new drumkit's loader using Pugi xml parser. Soon SFZ and the own, simple kit format has been added. Also I replaced note on/off leds to clickable buttons, made some redesign of the window, but I still feeled myself not comfortable with old code - I did not understand some parts of it. I found LV2 documentation too unclear for me. Alas!</p>

<p>After upgrade of my PC box I started to see that Ardour may record MIDI events with some pre-delay (or negative shift), and I readed about this bug and this was not fixed. I would be happy to use Drumrox in another DAW, Reaper, but DrMr UI is based on GTK2, and Reaper does not support GTK2 GUI!
I spend many time to play with small toolkits that produces X-based GUI, then (of course!) started to write the own one, but tried JUCE and... That how Drumlabooh was born!
</p>

<p>From the Drumrox I took my code of drumkits loader, ported it to JUCE file supports format, and resampler I took from Speex.</p>
