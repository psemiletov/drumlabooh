    <h2>NEWS</h2>

    <div class="news-entry">
      <div class="news-date">December 20 2025 — <a href="https://github.com/psemiletov/drumlabooh/releases/tag/12.0.0">Drumlabooh 12.0.0</a></div>

  <p> In the new release, there are a lot of changes, so read carefully — I'll briefly highlight the most important things.  </p>

<p>   Everything is covered in detail in the documentation on the Drumlabooh website. I finally betrayed my signature style of crappy websites and, with the help of AI, made a new one — to tell you how great my drum machine is, rather than forcing you to scroll through boring text.  
I also shot a new video for YouTube, showing the main features of Drumlabooh.  
</p>

<p>What's new?  </p>

<p>The graphical interface has been overhauled — and this isn't just rearranging controls. By the colors of the instrument slots, you can now determine the type: multi-layer, single layer, or a slot with alternative samples.  
</p>
<p>Everything related to loading drumkits has been moved to the left part of the window, and the options have been placed below the mixer. This allowed me to tidy up the code and unify the multi-channel and stereo interfaces of the plugin.  
</p>

<p>Added the <b>Rnd seed tweak</b> option for controlling the new pseudo-random number generator. Some drumkits in Drumlabooh have multi-layered instruments where a sample from the layer set is selected by a number obtained from the random number generator. This imitates the playing of a live drummer. In previous versions of Drumlabooh, this generator produced new sequences of numbers each time the drum part was played, resulting in slightly different drum sounds every time.  
</p>

<p>The new generator works smarter, like in top-tier drum machines. With it, each individual part will always have the same sequence of pseudo-random numbers, which depends on the Rnd seed tweak parameter. This is the "seed" for the pseudo-random number generator, ranging from 1 to 16777216.  
</p>
<p>Change the seed — get a new sequence. Set the seed back to the previous value — get the previous sequence back. The new generator significantly simplifies mixing, as the part's sound is now predictable.  
</p>

<p>But that's not all the changes to the Drumlabooh engine. The so-called "alternative" drumkits in Drumlabooh XML format, which existed in previous versions and allowed setting multiple sample variants in each slot, are now merged with the regular Drumlabooh XML format, and "alternative" slots can be mixed with slots of other types, for example, multi-layered or Round Robin.  
</p>

<p>In connection with this, the main electronic music drumkit — ASR-X Pro — has been reworked; now it contains both samples with alternatives and single samples.  
</p>

<p>The changes also affected the main "live" drumkits created based on Ludwig and Gretsch samples — the drumkits have been remade taking into account the new randomization engine, equipped with new covers, and the names have lost the trademarks. One could say that the new drumkits Sixties Basic, Sixties Rock, and Jazzkit are retuned versions of the previous "live" drumkits in Drumlabooh.  </p>


<p>If you have the old Ludwig Basic, Ludwig Sixties, and Gretsch Jazzkit installed and used in your songs, they remain on your hard drive and are still available under their original names. So, for new rock songs, use Sixties Basic, Sixties Rock, and Jazzkit — they are tuned precisely for the new capabilities of Drumlabooh.  
</p>

<p>In Drumlabooh 12, the main audio processing loop has been optimized — I won't go into details, I'll just say that a lot of unnecessary calculations have been removed, although the performance gain on modern processors doesn't seem as great as I had hoped.  
</p>

<p>In accordance with some changes on GitHub, the cmake build subsystem settings have been updated; the previous ones may now work with errors. So, if you tried to build the plugin from source before and it didn't work, now it should.
