   Drumlabooh 1.0.0

   Hello! The first major release ever. All known bugs were fixed, but let's talk about interesting things.
   The most cool one is FX section for each instrument. You can call/hide FX with the button "FX". There are two resonance filters (Low pass and High pass) to change the sound, and the magic "Analog" knob that warms up the sample.
  Other changes are more GUI-related - palette, drum cells highlighing, etc.
  A new "Wooden" drum kit has been added.  
  Other significant changes:
  Documentation updated.
  Stereo samples from kits now loaded as mono to simplify internal mixing. Pre-panned drums are evil.
