   Drumlabooh 11.0.0

  Hi, this release features not just some fixes and an upgrade to the new JUCE version, but also provides a new implementation of kit-defined mute groups. It works for Hydrogen, SFZ, and Drumlabooh XML kit formats. The automatic hi-hat muting still works if no other mute groups are defined in the kit file.
 
   Stay tuned, Peter Semiletov
