   Drumlabooh 6.0.0

   Just after a previous "big update" here is another one. Ready-to-use drumkits are good thing, but what about all that thouthands sample packs, commercial and free? We need a way to load and play any samples, not just from the drumkits!
   Thus, Drumlabooh 6 introduces the conception of Quick Kits (see the "Quick Custom Kits" section of the Manual). Using buttons "+" and "-" near the cell/slot name, you can add any external samples to the sample slots, remove samples from the slots, and save it as the Quick Kit with some name.
  Other news and fixes for this release - GUI at the multi-channel mode has been fixed; many few and boring fixes. Windows build rolled back to compile with JUCE 7, to make it compatible with Windows 7.
  The Manual at the homesite (https://psemiletov.github.io/drumlabooh/) is rewritten a lot.

   Stay tuned, Peter Semiletov
