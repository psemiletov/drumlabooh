   Drumlabooh 3.0.0

   What's new?

   Drumlabooh cmake-project for the build subsystem now supports old and modern cmake versions. Also, JUCE version 8 library is used instead of JUCE 7.
   Some good old drumkits were been added: ELI CompuRhythm CR 7030, SoundMaster SR-88, Technics PCM DP50, Cheetah SpecDrum Afro, Cheetah SpecDrum Electro, Cheetah SpecDrum Latin, Cheetah SpecDrum Standard.
   At DAW project, Drumlabooh now saves the drumkit path in the portable way, i.e., if your drumkit is located at some subdirectory of $HOME, that "home" part of the path will be saved as the macro. Here is a simple example.
   1. On Computer A, you have the drumkit "test" located at /home/userA/drumlabooh_kits/test.
   2. On Computer B, you have the drumkit "test" located at /home/userB/drumlabooh_kits/test.
   3. You can freely interchange DAW project that uses Drumlabooh with the drumkit "test", between Computer A and Computer B. Drumlabooh will load the kit "test" anyway, evaluating the actual home directory of the user.
