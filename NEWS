   Drumlabooh 11.1.0

   This release fixes a bug where the drum kit was loaded twice on the pluginâ€™s initial start. The main processing loop has been slightly optimized. A new version of the pugixml library is bundled. The documentation has undergone a major rewrite.The    
  Drumlabooh Quick Kit format is deprecated (but still supported) because it had an obscure GUI. Therefore, the Quick Kit editor components have been removed from the plugin window. You can use directories with samples instead if you need to create a simple kit quickly.
 
   Stay tuned, Peter Semiletov
