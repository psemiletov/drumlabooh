   Drumlabooh 5.0.0

   What's new?
   The UI was heavy redesigned to add new controls and options. The drumkits list now visible all the time instead of lurky combo box. This allows select kits in a more natural way. The new kits scanner provides kits list faster than before.
   To speed-up the loading of large kits with the samplerate that differs from session's samplerate, you can make a resampled copy of the kit using a new "Adapt" button.
   Another big enhancement is the MIDI mapping support via plugin's engine. Please read the Manual for details. With built-in mapping modes, you can turn on GM-compatibility mode for e-drums, pads or made Ardour's drum grooves sound right. Almost all Drumlabooh native format kits are updated for such compatibility. SFZ mapping setting are also supported.
   Pan mode and panning code are fixed, all panning modes now works as intended. The status log area has been added to make changes more visible. Many code was refactored and rewritten.

   Stay tuned, Peter Semiletov
